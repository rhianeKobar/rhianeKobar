<h2 id="About">About</h2> 

I'm a Frontend (almost fullstack) developer, UX Designer and I've just finished the Maker's Academy bootcamp. It's been
an intense experience yet incredibly rewarding and fulfilling. I'm super excited to work on/contribute to 
new/existing projects that help me strengthen and expand my skillset and meet other enthusiastic tech people. 

Put me to work on anything (*ethical*). Especially interested in open source, sustainability, accessibility, AI, communication,
data analysis, gaming, security, mobile, transport and education.

The bootcamp has helped me develop my skills in test driven development and I can't believe I ever coded without testing! 
I love working in teams, everyone brings something of value to the table and it's great to have other people to bounce ideas off of, 
celebrate the victories and lean on or be support for. However, I can work by myself and have developed a good strategy for debugging. 
I'd be really excited to work with a team that recognises the importance of diversity and inclusion, preferably with the option to work remotely. 

Outside of coding, I play bass in a band called Petit Danger (we're not even on bandcamp yet so don't 
look :haha), I love fermenting and growing things, playing mario kart (add me on switch) and DIY.

Like many Maker's Alumni, I consider myself language agnostic and I'm eager to work with 
many tools and languages, however the following are what I'm most familiar with:
