[Skillset](#Skillset) | [Portfolio](#Porfolio) | [Work Experience](#Work)| [Education](#edu)



I'm a Fullstack developer, UX Designer and I've just finished the Maker's Academy bootcamp. It's been
an intense experience yet incredibly rewarding and fulfilling. I'm super excited to work on/contribute to 
new/existing projects that help me strengthen and expand my skillset and meet incredible techies. 

Put me to work on anything (*ethical*). Especially interested in open source, sustainability, accessibility, AI, communication,
data analysis, gaming, security, mobile, transport and education.

The bootcamp has helped me develop my skills in test driven development and I can't believe I ever coded without testing! 
I love working in teams, everyone brings something of value to the table and it's great to have other people to bounce ideas off of, 
celebrate the victories and lean on or be support for. However, I can work by myself and have developed a good strategy for debugging. 
I'd be really excited to work with a team that recognises the importance of diversity and inclusion, preferably with the option to work remotely. 

Outside of coding, I play bass in a band called Petit Danger (we're not even on bandcamp yet so don't 
look ðŸ˜†), I love fermenting and growing things, playing mario kart (add me on switch) and DIY.

Like many Maker's Alumni, I consider myself language agnostic and I'm eager to work with 
new tools and languages, however the following are what I'm most familiar with for now:

### Soft skills

Knowing the stack you're working with is important but having soft skills is equally important I'd say! Working in teams is a joy and very few products are built entirely by one person! It's important to me to be someone who **communicates well**, is **empathetic** and **patient** towards others, is **flexible** where I can be and **maintains accountability and transparency**. I love working with diverse groups of people (something we got to do a lot of at Makers), it helps **keep an open mind** and is a good reminder that **everyone has someone of value to bring to the table**!
